## 📋 Dependencies

This script requires the following resources to be installed and running:

- **[qbx_core](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core)** - QBX Core Framework
- **[ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)** - Overextended Library (UI, notifications, callbacks)
- **[ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)** - Overextended Inventory System

## 📦 Installation

1. **Download** the latest release or clone this repository
2. **Extract** the folder to your server's `resources` directory
3. **Rename** the folder to `LPD-Xmasairdrop` (or your preferred name)
4. **Add** the following to your `server.cfg`:
   ```cfg
   ensure LPD-Xmasairdrop
   ```
5. **Configure** the script in `config.lua` (see Configuration section below)
6. **Restart** your server or use `/refresh` and `/start LPD-Xmasairdrop`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Basic Settings

Edit `config.lua` to customize the script:

```lua
-- When the event triggers
Config.TargetHour = 0          -- Hour (0-23, 0 = midnight)
Config.TargetMinute = 0        -- Minute (0-59)

-- Present settings
Config.NumberOfPresents = 3    -- How many presents drop per event
Config.DropInterval = 5000     -- Time between drops (milliseconds)
Config.PresentLifetime = 600000 -- How long presents stay (10 minutes)
Config.PresentScale = 4.0      -- Size multiplier (creates cluster effect)

-- Minimum players needed for event
Config.MinimumPlayerCount = 0  -- Set to 0 to always run
```

### Drop Zone Configuration

Customize where presents can land:

```lua
Config.DropZone = {
    center = vector3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),  -- Center point (map coordinates)
    minRadius = 500.0,                 -- Minimum distance from center
    maxRadius = 2000.0                 -- Maximum distance from center
}
```

**Example locations:**
- Los Santos City Center: `vector3(200.0, -900.0, 30.0)`
- Sandy Shores: `vector3(1850.0, 3700.0, 30.0)`
- Paleto Bay: `vector3(-100.0, 6400.0, 30.0)`

### Loot Pool Configuration

Customize what items players can receive. Each item has:
- `item` - Item spawn name
- `minAmount` / `maxAmount` - Quantity range
- `weight` - Drop chance (higher = more common)

```lua
Config.LootPool = {
    {item = 'weapon_pistol', minAmount = 1, maxAmount = 1, weight = 5},
    {item = 'money', minAmount = 5000, maxAmount = 25000, weight = 20},
    -- Add your custom items here
}
```

### Sleigh Route

Customize the flight path:

```lua
Config.SleighRoute = {
    vector3(-1000.0, -1000.0, 150.0),  -- Start point
    vector3(0.0, 0.0, 150.0),          -- Middle waypoint
    vector3(1000.0, 1000.0, 150.0),    -- End point
}
```

## 🎵 Adding Sounds (Optional)

1. **Create** the folder structure:
   ```
   LPD-Xmasairdrop/
   └── html/
       ├── index.html
       └── sounds/
           ├── sleigh_bells.ogg
           └── unwrap_present.ogg
   ```

2. **Download** royalty-free Christmas sounds from:
   - [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
   - [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
   - [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/)

3. **Convert** to `.ogg` format using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or online converters

4. **Enable** sounds in config:
   ```lua
   Config.PlaySounds = true
   ```

5. The `html/index.html` file is already included in the repository

## 🎮 Commands

### Player Commands
- `/checktime` - Check the current in-game time

### Admin Commands
- `/santaevent` - Manually trigger the Christmas event (requires admin permission)

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Present Prop

To use a different present model:

```lua
Config.PresentProp = 'prop_xmas_present_01'  -- Change to any valid prop
```

### Change Sleigh Model

To use a different vehicle as the sleigh:

```lua
Config.SleighModel = 'volatus'  -- Any helicopter or aircraft model
Config.SleighSpeed = 50.0       -- Adjust flight speed
```

### Adjust Interaction

```lua
Config.InteractionDistance = 3.0  -- How close players must be
Config.OpenTime = 5000            -- Time to open present (ms)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Event not triggering
- Check in-game time with `/checktime`
- Ensure `Config.MinimumPlayerCount` requirement is met
- Check server console for debug messages (enable with `Config.Debug = true`)

### Presents not appearing
- Verify `Config.PresentProp` model exists on your server
- Check F8 client console for errors
- Ensure ox_lib is properly installed

### Loot not given
- Verify item names match your `ox_inventory` items exactly
- Check server console for errors
- Ensure qbx_core is running properly

### Sounds not playing
- Verify sound files are in `.ogg` format
- Check file names match config exactly (`sleigh_bells.ogg`, `unwrap_present.ogg`)
- Ensure `html/index.html` exists
- Set `Config.PlaySounds = true`

## 📝 Debug Mode

Enable detailed console logging:

```lua
Config.Debug = true
```

This will print detailed information about:
- Event triggers
- Present creation
- Loot generation
- Player interactions
